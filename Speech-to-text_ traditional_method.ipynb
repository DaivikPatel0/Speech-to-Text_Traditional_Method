    "1) `sounddevice` - To record audio from your microphone in real-time, so we can capture raw audio directly from your PC’s mic and save the audio as NumPy arrays (which we later convert to .wav).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `scipy` - It saves the Numpy array from `sounddevice` into an actual `.wav` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) `librosa` - It converts `.wav` into MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), which converts raw sound into machine-readable numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) `numpy` - The foundation for numerical operations and array handling. All the audio data, MFCCs, and intermediate steps are handled using NumPy arrays. This will be used throughout data prep, training, and model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) `matplotlib` - For visualizing the audio waveform or MFCCs. Also helps for debugging and understanding what features we are extracting. Plotting spectrograms, MFCC matrices, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) `hmmlearn` - To build the actual Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that will learn and decode speech patterns. This is the core engine that maps speech features to text without neural networks or pretrained models.\n",
    "- It allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Train a model using sequences (like MFCCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use GaussianHMM to model acoustic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Apply Viterbi decoding to predict the best word/digit. (Not explicitly, but when we call the HMM model.score() it internally uses the log-likelihood computation, which is based on the Viterbi algorithm )"

    "A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a sequence model with two main layers:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Observations** — the actual data we can see (e.g., MFCC features extracted from audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian HMM means the observations are modelled using Gaussian (normal) distributions in each hidden state. Because speech/audio features (like MFCCs) are continuous and vary smoothly, a Gaussian distribution is a natural fit to model them in each state, so in each state the model learns the mean and variance of your MFCC vectors. We have trained total 35 models."

    "This `predict_live()` function is responsible for performing real-time word prediction based on a recorded speech signal. It first extracts features from the input signal (live audio) including MFCC, as well as delta and delta², which capture the dynamic aspects of speech. These features are then normalized to ensure consistency across recordings. After that function evaluates the likelihood of the extracted features against each trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to determine which word the signal most closely resembles."

    "This project effectively demonstrated the development of a fundamental speech recognition system using classical machine learning approaches—specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Through systematic audio preprocessing and feature extraction, we achieved approximately 71% accuracy in live word prediction, validating the capability of traditional models in limited-vocabulary scenarios. The implementation deepened our understanding of speech signal processing, sequence modelling, and statistical classification. Moreover, it underscored the relevance of foundational techniques in resource-constrained environments and provided a solid platform for future enhancements involving neural networks, larger vocabularies, and real-time applications."
